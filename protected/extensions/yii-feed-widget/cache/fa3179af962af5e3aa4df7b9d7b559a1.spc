<p dir="ltr">In the world of mobile apps, the biggest news from this week was the announcement, by Facebook, of a new app, built by the social network, to read news and stories: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/paper">Paper</a>. Make sure to watch the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhrbT9O6kW8">video</a>, which is very Apple-esque in its elegance and emotion. When Facebook announces these kind of apps, it evokes memories of their previous attempts to build and distribute standalone apps that unbundle one of its features, such as Camera, Poke, or Messenger. The initial reaction within the technology startup community has been a mix of skepticism and excitement, with some drooling over the new design (it does look good) while others lament its a copy (some interactions do look like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flipboard.com">Flipboard</a>).</p>
<p>This all begs a question: Will Paper go the way of Poke, or the way of Messenger? The answer will have big consequences for Facebook.</p>
<p>On mobile devices, Messenger has been successfully unbundled from Facebook. Messenger is one of the top messaging apps out there, it works great, and even today, Facebook is so focused on making sure everyone has it on their phones that they actually route users who are inside Facebook&#8217;s main app entirely out to Messenger (and then back in) to coax the behavior of using Messenger itself. With Poke, as we all can recall, even Facebook wasn&#8217;t able to use its enormous, engaged mobile user base to turn it into a real experience to <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.semilshah.com/2013/12/30/how-snapchat-became-the-breakout-consumer-product-of-2013/">rival</a> Snapchat. This episode was a highly visible example of how Facebook&#8217;s high mobile engagement could shoot any app right to the top of the charts, but also exposed the limits of its power to affect mobile engagement as users quickly abandoned the product experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to Facebook and mobile, we are witnessing the early stages of the company&#8217;s attempt to unbundle and distribute its core features in new mobile products. Back in September 2011, I wrote a column right <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/the-facebook-iphone/">here</a> on TechCrunch which argued Facebook&#8217;s strategy for blanketing our devices with their software was to break it up. You can read that post <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/the-facebook-iphone/">here</a>, and make sure to check out the picture. Two and a half years later, Facebook is in a much stronger mobile position. Earlier this week for earnings, Facebook shared mobile stats, reporting nearly <a target="_blank" href="http://gordonbowman.com/post/75063536203/in-charts-facebooks-rise-in-mobile">950m MAUs and 550m DAU&#8217;s</a>. This type of scale and engagement for mobile apps affords Facebook incredible amounts of actionable data, which translates to market power, which they use to <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.semilshah.com/2013/08/13/some-thoughts-on-facebooks-ads-stock-price-and-instagram/">line their pockets</a> through mobile app install ads &#8212; just wait until they roll out mobile re-engagement ads and deep-linking options, as well.</p>
<p>Can Facebook, moving forward, effectively leverage the power and scale of its own network to drive its daily active users to new mobile experiences (as they&#8217;re doing with Messenger), or will users only temporarily flock to only to abandon them (as they did with Poke)? And, in the case of Paper specifically, will users convert to getting real-time mobile push notifications about news and stories about their friends, or will they find this spammy and revert back to their original sources of news (which includes regular Facebook)?</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see the world&#8217;s reaction tomorrow (February 3) when Paper is released. Two great pieces on this are by TechCrunch&#8217;s own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/joshconstine">Josh Constine</a>, who takes a deep dive on<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/one-app-at-a-time/"> Facebook&#8217;s Plot To Conquer Mobile: Shatter Itself Into Pieces</a>, and Wanelo&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/besvinick">Adam Besvinick</a>, who looks <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/philosophy-logic/2a695e4529ee">beyond the motive to unbundle</a> when it comes to Paper. Facebook is a very different mobile company today than it was a year ago, or two years ago. The scale is just massive, and the engagement is off the charts. Assuming the product experience itself is relevant, which is why news and personal stories are interesting, even a low conversion rate to Paper would be a very sizeable audience. The reason we see more and more news apps on our phones or in the App Store is because checking the news isn&#8217;t just a daily active use case, it&#8217;s a <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.semilshah.com/2013/08/26/a-story-about-threading-the-needle-on-mobile/">multiple-times-a-day hyperactive use case</a>, and one that Facebook, with their mobile user data, their algorithms, and their scale and engagement, could exploit with this move and be the first thing people read in the morning &#8212; just like the newspaper used to be. Only time will tell, so pick up the Paper tomorrow morning and read all about it.</p>

A spokesperson for video advertising and analytics company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.visiblemeasures.com">Visible Measures</a>, told me that his team looked at every Super Bowl campaign since 2010 and found that more and more advertisers are following this strategy — there were 13 in 2010, 27 in 2011, 34 in 2012, and 42 in last year.

<p>Basically, it seems that advertisers now treat the game as just part of a monthlong campaign, one where online views are increasingly important. As Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/01/super-bowl-ads-without-the-super-bowl.html">told The New Yorker</a>: &#8220;It is not about winning the Super Bowl but winning an entire month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Super Bowl ads saw a total of 370 million online views last year, Visible Measures said (measured one month after the game). And advertisers who release the ads early are the ones who win, according to the company&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>Visible Measures <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/14/visible-measures-funding/">says it tracks a video&#8217;s &#8220;True Reach&#8221; across the web</a>, including sites like YouTube, DailyMotion, Metacafe, and Vimeo. When the brands released their ads ahead of time, they saw significantly higher True Reach  than those that didn&#8217;t &#8212; the difference peaked at 600 percent more views in 2012 before falling to 200 percent last year, presumably due to increased competition for online attention.</p>
<p>As one example, Visible Measures pointed to Samsung&#8217;s video &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIUsuG3HL5A">The Big Pitch</a>,&#8221; which had already been viewed 8.7 million times by the time the Super Bowl aired, and which had a total of 33.5 million online views a month later. And this year, Budweiser&#8217;s &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQB7QRyF4p4">Puppy Love</a>&#8221; ad (embedded below) has already been viewed 26.7 million times &#8212; so its final viewer count is going to pretty impressive.</p>

<p>When I joined the Industry Analyst community in 2000 the industry was much smaller. For those in the business and analyst community who were in the field decades prior it was even smaller still. Early in my career as an analyst I was studying the semiconductor industry as it related to markets like PCs, mobile phones (not smartphones), digital home and a few other consumer-facing segments.</p>
<p>In those days, the PC was the talk of the town. It was on a steady growth stream and the only question we would debate internally is how much the industry would grow in the next few years and how many more PCs we would sell in the years to come. The PC crossed the 100 million in annual shipments mark in 1999 then crossed the 200 million annual shipment mark in 2004. I recall discussions with many of the PC vendors and major suppliers of semiconductors and there was so much excitement that the industry would sell 200 millions PCs every year from here on out. The big question was when would we get to 300 million?</p>
<p>Well, that happened in 2009 and shipments have never gotten over 400 million since.</p>
<p>During those days, the industry felt larger than ever. Hundreds of millions of PCs were being shipped each year and exciting growth in computing was taking place. Now, today, when I give industry presentations and keynotes at events, my language has shifted from hundreds of millions to billions and trillions as I talk about the industry going forward.</p>
<p>The economies of scale of the global technology industry are often lost and under-appreciated by many industry commentators. Several things have happened in a short amount of time, which has led to the remarkable economies of scale we are now talking about in the technology industry.</p>
<p>The first is that the industry itself has matured. When you see more evolution than revolution coming from leading companies, then you know a segment has reached a nadir of sorts. This does not mean revolution isn&#8217;t possible or still doesn&#8217;t happen &#8212; only that it is less frequent. Think about the automotive industry for example. This is one of the most mature industries and do we see revolutionary products frequently? No, and this is why it can no longer be expected to be a frequent thing in the technology industry.</p>
<p>Mature industries act differently once they have matured and then march on toward post-maturity. You can look at consumer electronics, packaged goods, automotive and even all the way back to railways and shipping industries. The markets that make up industries when they mature act differently as well. Primarily when an industry matures the consumer of the products of those industries understand more about what they want from the product or service and start searching out things that serve their unique needs, wants, or desires. This is what opens the door for broader competition and segmentation, and it is when this happens that the competitive dynamics within a market often change.</p>
<p>The second is that the tech industry has gone global. Thanks to the industry being mature we can now bring nearly every class of consumer technology product to the masses at a variety of price points. The power of local manufacturing in China, and the growing capabilities of India, Latin America and other countries are accelerating the pace of the industries growth and bringing with it challenging implications for foreign brands.</p>
<p>Case in point, a company I love to study based in China named Xiaomi recently unseated Samsung and Apple to take the top smartphone sales spot in the month of December, according to Kantar. This is quite remarkable for a local Chinese upstart fewer than four years old.</p>
<p>The result of the industry maturing and going global is the foundation of why we are no longer talking about millions but billions of annual device shipments and billions of connected devices in use in the marketplace.</p>
<p>My firm estimates that by the end of 2014 there will be over 4 billion PCs, smartphones, and tablets in use. I forecast that by the end of 2018 the annual sales of smartphones will be approximately 1.8 billion. Every time I think about this single number it astonishes me. Every year, almost 2 billion smartphones are sold. Astounding. There may not be a single product with this kind of total addressable market.</p>
<p>Things start to sound even crazier when we start talking about the Internet of things. We are counting down the time before we hit 50 billion connected objects. That number will be quickly eclipsed by 100 billion connected objects as we march toward an inevitable future where we have 1 trillion-plus connected objects in the world. These connected objects will surround us in our homes, cities and workplaces, and will even be embedded into everyday objects like our household appliances, cars, beds, shoes, sports equipment, and clothing.</p>
<p>There is tremendous opportunity ahead for everyone participating in advancing the technology industry. This is not a zero-sum game where for someone else to succeed someone else has to fail. This fact is a core trait of a mature industry. This industry is large enough to sustain a number of healthy growing companies all thriving for decades to come.</p>
<p>Those of us who write about, observe, analyze, and work in this industry are on a journey. However, on a journey the scenery changes. And while this industry is mature, there is still much change that will take place in the years to come. I believe we are just about halfway through this journey and this adventure will be filled with twists and turns for decades to come.</p>

It&#8217;s called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.taskworld.com/">Taskworld</a> and it&#8217;s a task-management app that is all about measuring performance.</p>
<p>In Mouawad&#8217;s view, the better you can manage performance, the better the projects will be. The projects will get done faster and the people will get better through the feedback they receive.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mouawad.com/">Mouawad&#8217;s family</a> has been in the jewelry trade since the late 19th century when David Mouawad learned the art of watchmaking and over time became known for his intricate work that became popular with wealthy clients. Today, Fred Mouawad and his brothers are the fourth generation to manage the Mouawad business. They have headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, with Middle East headquarters in Dubai.</p>
<p>Mouawad himself has helped diversify the company&#8217;s holdings to encompass dozens of brands. He is the chairman and CEO of Synergia Brands, which serves as the umbrella organization for the Mouawad organization and assorted brands that includes Taskworld, his latest project. Fred Mouawad developed 15 brands for the company and founded seven of the companies. Taskworld now has a team of 50 people.</p>
<p>His team has built a tool that helps companies stop using email as a way to do project management. Inefficient, time-consuming and tedious, email has no built in metrics, so tasks can&#8217;t be measured or prioritized.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">The app allows people to input their tasks with target completion dates. It has a feed that provides notifications and comes with a dashboard for measuring how much of the project is completed. Though it bypasses email for the actual project management, Taskworld is currently integrated with Outlook and Gmail for alerts and notifications. It can also be integrated into any existing customer email.</span></p>

<p>Interactions are shared, for example, when opening and closing a task. It&#8217;s this interaction data that serves as the foundation for measuring performance.</p>

<p>Employees get their own dashboard to see how they are performing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-948489" alt="taskworld" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/tw3.png?w=640&#038;h=369" width="640" height="369" /></p>
<p>There are dozens of task management tools in the market. <a target="_blank" href="http://wrike.com">Wrike</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://asana.com">Asana</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://atlassian.com">Atlassian</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.any.do/">Any.do</a> &#8212; the list goes on. Wrike, for example, has features for the professional project manager such as its Gantt charts. Asana has built-in reminders about the tasks that have been assigned and completed and are over due</p>
<p>Taskworld&#8217;s technology plays to human emotions. As the feedback is continuous, people are compelled to engage with the service.</p>
<p>But in some respects, Taskworld is fairly simple and still needing more to make it a potent competitor in the market. Regardless, the focus on performance is unique and gives Taskworld a foundation to build a service that can compete on the world stage.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:124:"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/01/a-billionaire-jewelry-king-launches-taskworld-a-management-tool-all-about-performance/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:2:{s:7:"content";a:6:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:79:"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/5142732068_c4e11bc127_z.jpg";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";s:6:"medium";s:5:"image";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:113:"Billionaire%20Jewelry%20King%20Launches%20TaskWorld%2C%20A%20Management%20Tool%20All%20About%26nbsp%3BPerformance";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:7:"

<p>Everyone talks about user experience. It&#8217;s often referred to in terms of how &#8220;sticky&#8221; an app is: how easy it is to use, how engaging it is, how relevant it is to what users are doing, etc. All are elements that contribute to a compelling experience, regardless of industry or app type. But while user experience is well understood and has always been core to the development and success of consumer-facing apps, the same is hardly true in the enterprise world.</p>
<p>So why is that and what are we &#8211; as enterprise software companies &#8211; doing about it?</p>
<p>To make a lasting impact and to drive change within it requires an entirely new way of thinking about software development and large-scale technology projects. It&#8217;s also one that suggests we look to our consumer counterparts for guidance on how to put the user first and build technology second.</p>
<p>If we mimic companies like Uber and GoPro &#8211; resisting the temptation to simply recreate old experiences in a new environment &#8211; we&#8217;ll enable entirely new, powerful use cases. We&#8217;ll move away from the old standard of iteration to a new standard of true innovation. We&#8217;ll create business value that didn&#8217;t exist previously that ultimately makes companies more competitive. We&#8217;ll make the economy stronger. We might even make the world better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a massive challenge, but it&#8217;s also a massive opportunity.</p>
<h2><b>What You Want To Do vs. How You Get There</b></h2>
<p>Technology has gotten a lot easier and more efficient because many companies are moving to cloud computing and adopting more mobile devices. Traditional tasks are becoming automated, and apps no longer come with a user manual because experiences are just that intuitive.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s about more than that. As our world continues to evolve, we cannot continue thinking of technology in terms of dollars saved or hosting data outside company walls. It&#8217;s not just about cost effectiveness and the bottom line. We must break out of the traditional &#8216;technology view&#8217; and start to think about what technology now makes possible, creating new experiences and delivering top-line value in the process.</p>
<p>When the founders of Uber initially had the idea for the app, they didn&#8217;t think about a huge logistics network for routing luxury cars and cabs. Instead, they thought about making it possible to have a town car drive up to anyone&#8217;s location with a few taps of their iPhone. They thought about the user experience and innovated by focusing on delighting them versus the back-end technology to make it possible. <span style="line-height:1.625;">GoPro is another example. Their team didn&#8217;t think about the technology behind creating a mobile camera to mount anywhere, one that was waterproof and offered high-res video or stop motion. They thought about their love for surfing and how to capture those incredible moments no matter where they were.</span></p>
<p>The enterprise world needs to borrow a page from the playbook of the Ubers and GoPros of the consumer world. We must first focus on helping the user do what they want to do and then build the sophisticated technology to get there.</p>
<h2><b>Healthcare.Gov: Right Time, Wrong Focus</b></h2>
<p>Thinking about the user first is an entirely new way of thinking in software development. We&#8217;re pivoting from the concept of functional requirements focused on business processes and data flows and turning everything around so the focus is on the end user. We&#8217;re thinking about allowing them to do what they want to do no matter where they are or the device they&#8217;re on.</p>
<p>The recent Healthcare.gov debacle is a good example of the old way of thinking. With Healthcare.gov integrating data from many different agencies, developers focused on looking at the data that needed to be integrated rather than the usability of the information. Focusing on usability would have led to making better decisions about how to best handle all of that data. Developers could have concluded that pricing information and plan details could be retrieved in infrequent batches, rather than in real-time, since that type of data is unlikely to change minute-by-minute. These issues could have been sidestepped if developers had focused on consumer use cases &#8211; and what they would try to do once they landed on the site &#8211; rather than back-end issues. As a result, the project was doomed from the outset.</p>
<h2><b>So, What Can We Do?</b></h2>
<p>What&#8217;s possible when you focus on the user first and technology second? It&#8217;s still too early to really tell, but the future does look bright.</p>
<p>It comes down to the opportunity for people to use apps and devices that make them most productive whenever and wherever they need them. It&#8217;s the ability to remove the barriers to getting business done so they can collaborate across companies &#8211; and so partners and customers can get access to the resources and information they need more easily.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s especially exciting is that there&#8217;s an innovation &#8216;ripple effect&#8217; that takes place. By delivering intuitive and powerful software that just works, companies will be able to focus on new projects that differentiate their organizations. They&#8217;ll create new ways to engage with partners and customers, build entirely new products that drive top-line revenue, and design innovative new workflows that set them apart from competitors.</p>
<p>Ask any CIO what the biggest impact of cloud and mobile has been on their world, and they&#8217;ll talk about the transformation of their role within the enterprise to be &#8220;business enablers,&#8221; allowing employees and partners to be more productive, creative and competitive instead of gatekeepers.</p>
<p>The user experience is essential to any modern technology project today, and how organizations prioritize usability to deliver new experiences separates the wheat from the chaff. If we enable our customers to simply recreate business processes and apps of the client-server era in new environments, we fail. We fail as an industry, as a community and as individual companies.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much more opportunity than that and we need to go after those opportunities before someone else does.</p>

<p>The report, which is written for the magazine&#8217;s general news audience, could serve as a sort of &#8220;State of the Union&#8221; for the industry. That means a lot of what&#8217;s reported there won&#8217;t really be news to those of you who are deeply involved in the startup world.</p>
<p>There are no big surprises or gotcha moments, for instance, in its various stories on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21593592-biggest-professional-training-system-you-have-never-heard-getting-up-speed">boom in accelerators</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21593590-why-southern-china-best-place-world-hardware-innovator-be-hacking">move by hardware startups and suppliers to embrace Shenzhen</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21593582-what-entrepreneurial-ecosystems-need-flourish-all-together-now">growth of tech ecosystems in communities around the world</a>.</p>
<p>But where The Economist&#8217;s report could be useful is in helping those of us who follow this world every day to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/see_the_forest_for_the_trees">see the forest for the trees</a>. In so doing, it we could possibly better understand the broader global impact that the spread of technology is having, how we&#8217;ve gotten here, and what the big trends are driving us forward. What it really means when <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software eats the world</a>, as it were.</p>
<p>And hey, maybe you don&#8217;t know much about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21593586-how-build-companies-kit-rocket-machine">how Rocket Internet operates</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21593583-proliferating-digital-platforms-will-be-heart-tomorrows-economy-and-even">why platforms have become so important</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21593591-are-startups-just-workaholic-white-male-lumpen-preneurs-founders-blues">negative psychological effects that entrepreneurship has on some founders</a>. If any of that is of interest, it&#8217;s in there, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, I highly recommend you <a target="_blank" href="http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/sponsorships/[KY56b]Huawei/180114_SR.pdf">download the full PDF</a>, save it for a quiet moment when you have some spare time, and read it in its entirety. Because every now and then it&#8217;s good to take a big step back, re-learn the things you think you already know, and maybe see the tech world from another person&#8217;s point of view.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/01/required-reading-the-economists-special-report-on-tech-startups/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:2:{s:7:"content";a:3:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:84:"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/the-economist-special-report.png";s:4:"type";s:9:"image/png";s:6:"medium";s:5:"image";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"Required%20Reading%3A%20The%20Economist%26%238217%3Bs%20Special%20Report%20On%20Tech%26nbsp%3BStartups";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:7:"

I pointed this out as perhaps the start of new stability for Bitcoin, which in turn could help its platform mature, or indicate maturation thereof. There was some squawking that the time frame I had selected as &#8216;enough&#8217; to indicate a trend was too short. It was a reasonable complaint. Happily, Bitcoin has behaved and exonerated me by tacking on another tranche of time of generally stable prices. The gist is simple: For nearly the entire month of January Bitcoin has traded in the 900s, with minor exceptions in 1,000s. For a currency that until very recently could see 50% of its value drop in a day and not have that day stand out all too much, it has been something of a calming of the seas. Here&#8217;s the D1 chart you need (Mt.Gox data via Clark Moody): Why does it matter if Bitcoin is seeing increasing price stability? Essentially the more wild the swings in its value, the less useful Bitcoin is as a tool of commerce. This goes both ways: The more real uses there are for Bitcoin, the smaller the percentage of speculative trades in the currency; and, the smaller the changes in its price, the more people may start to accept Bitcoin as a payment option. It&#8217;s a self-reinforcing cycle. Marc Andreessen recently summed this well: &#8220;Bitcoin is a classic network effect, a positive feedback loop. The more people who use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin is for everyone who uses it, and the higher the incentive for the next user to start using the technology.&#8221; Marc&#8217;s piece &#8212; it&#8217;s mandatory reading, by the way &#8212; lays out a bullish case for Bitcoin arguing that its core technological tenets provide large incentive for its use, which will drive adoption and long-term use.   Bitcoin volume on the Mt.Gox exchange is down sharply this year, a change I think that is roughly commensurate with the currency&#8217;s decline in media attention.

The app rethinks the calendar as a gesture-based playground, rather than a spreadsheet-esque chore. It&#8217;s an attempt at designed interaction, with a minimalist interface that incorporates a playful, gesture-based UI &#8212; itself flagged up by the cheeky name Peek. The look and feel of this calendar combines flat design &#8212; via rich blocks of colour &#8212; with a mischievous sense of dimensionality that allows subtly sign-posted calendar entries to fold open like origami when tapped on and hinge-closed again, simultaneously mocking the lie of flat design while embracing its seamless perfection. To the uninitiated user, Peek&#8217;s interface can appear enigmatic or even inscrutable at first glance &#8212; with a rack of icons swiping into view that look alien rather than immediately obvious, and a series of interface gestures required to navigate the app&#8217;s functions, which don&#8217;t immediately leap out as intuitive and absolutely do require a little poking and prodding around to get into the swing of. Yet, spend some time getting to know Peek, unlocking its finger signs and flat symbols, and the interface transforms &#8212; or rather unfolds, revealing hidden depths of fun and functionality beneath an intentionally minimalist exterior. &#8220;Instead of using the conventional navigational elements, we decided to build Peek from the ground up,&#8221; says Peek designer Amid Moradganjeh. &#8220;We believe interfaces can be more about the content. Focusing on the content makes the conventional navigational elements less visible, and using gestural control allows the design to be cleaner, quieter and more ambient. This can actually speed up the process of using calendar. &#8220;There is also an element of play in Peek,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We wanted to introduce new behaviors that are more fun to use. We believe that fun does not necessarily have to be less functional.&#8221; Peek&#8217;s sense of fun can be summed up by a shake gesture feature that allows the user to ask the app to come up with an idea for something new to do in future &#8212; such as &#8216;read something inspirational&#8217; or &#8216;call someone you miss&#8217; &#8212; which they can then choose to add to their calendar at a random time &#8216;soon&#8217; (or not at all).

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-950978" alt="Peek" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/screen-shot-2014-02-01-at-02-06-46.png?w=300&#038;h=268" width="300" height="268" />Yet, spend some time getting to know Peek, unlocking its finger signs and flat symbols, and the interface transforms &#8212; or rather unfolds, revealing hidden depths of fun and functionality beneath an intentionally minimalist exterior.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Instead of using the conventional navigational elements, we decided to build Peek from the ground up,&#8221; says Peek designer Amid Moradganjeh.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We believe interfaces can be more about the content. Focusing on the content makes the conventional navigational elements less visible, and using gestural control allows the design to be cleaner, quieter and more ambient. This can actually speed up the process of using calendar.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is also an element of play in Peek,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We wanted to introduce new behaviors that are more fun to use. We believe that fun does not necessarily have to be less functional.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-950998" alt="Peek-screenahotPhone5" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/peek-screenahotphone5.jpg?w=359&#038;h=640"   />Peek&#8217;s sense of fun can be summed up by a shake gesture feature that allows the user to ask the app to come up with an idea for something new to do in future &#8212; such as &#8216;read something inspirational&#8217; or &#8216;call someone you miss&#8217; &#8212; which they can then choose to add to their calendar at a random time &#8216;soon&#8217; (or not at all).</p>
<p>So, yep: Peek&#8217;s got serendipity diarized.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the sort of person whose heart sinks every time you have to call up and fill out a form to create a new event in Google Calendar (or its utilitarian ilk), exactly because it&#8217;s all check boxes and text input fields,  then Peek&#8217;s purity of design is probably going to feel like a balm. Or a calendar panacea.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, if you&#8217;re the type of professional time segmenter who relishes absolute granular specificity in slicing and dicing each and every one of your half hours on this earth, well, Peek will probably bring you out in half-day hives.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the startup describes the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.peekcalendar.com/design.html">design ethos</a> it&#8217;s taking with Peek:</p>
<blockquote><p>Peek is about cutting away the overwhelming features of mobile calendars. It redefines an on the go experience for people to use when they need it, so that they are not consumed by its entirety and benefit from its existence.</p>
<p>Peek is not just a minimalist and simple app, it is designed to be the right resolution for the context it is being used in. It is made to provide the necessary information in an easy to understand manner, without overwhelming you with data you might not need.</p></blockquote>
<p>The app is the first product from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.squaremountains.com/">Square Mountains</a>, a new startup co-founded by Moradganjeh last July, and Patryk Zoltowski (who has a background in enterprise web app development). Designer Moradganjeh previously worked at vaunted design firm <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ideo">IDEO</a>, and also at Microsoft (the latter may explain Peek&#8217;s distinct whiff of Windows Phone &#8212; an early and ongoing champion of flat design).</p>
<p>Square Mountains, which is based in San Francisco and Tallinn, Estonia, has a self-professed design focus clearly evident in this, its first product. A design ethos that&#8217;s hardly surprising given the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ideo.com/work/">IDEO</a> connection.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that there is an opportunity to apply design thinking to the existing products and make them more useful for bigger groups of people,&#8221; says Moradganjeh when asked what problem the startup is aiming to solve generally. &#8220;We do not want to just come up with a new idea and introduce another gadget that only a small group of people might find useful.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">&#8220;</span>We have an approach which is very simple: understanding what people really value, coming up with new ideas, and then pushing technology to bring those ideas to life. Our goal is to apply the same approach and principles to other experiences and create more innovative products for people by using design.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Peek specifically, Moradganjeh reiterates that the aim is not to compete with calendar apps designed for power users, such as Sunrise, Tempo and Mynd. He argues that those are apps that &#8220;<span style="line-height:1.625;">try to give too much to the users,&#8221; whereas Peek is designed for far less-focused folk.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">&#8220;We think the smart calendars like Sunrise, Tempo and Mynd are great for the type of users they are designed for. But with Peek, we are addressing the needs of a different group, a bigger group, people that are not necessarily that busy. They simply need to manage time on the go without being overloaded by unnecessary information and features,&#8221; he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">&#8220;For this group, if using a calendar app is not easier than remembering things or writing them on a piece of paper, then they would not use it. Our goal was to make Peek a more relevant tool for them so they can also benefit from managing time on their smartphones.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Another goal for the app is evidently to act as a design showcase for what Square Mountains can do &#8212; to help it when it goes out seeking <span style="line-height:1.625;">funds for what Moradganjeh refers to as &#8221;bigger projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">&#8220;We are currently experimenting with some new ideas that we hope will turn into products soon,&#8221; he adds, without being more specific about Square Mountains&#8217; plans.</span></p>
<p>While Peek looks very nice on the surface, Moradganjeh concedes it is something of a &#8220;creative risk,&#8221; being as it&#8217;s so unconventional in its navigation &#8212; and thus requires users to put in the effort to learn it. Certainly I found my patience for figuring out the folds and foibles of certain sub-menus and deeper functions being tested. Portions of the design definitely felt as if they over-indulged at the expense of utility.</p>
<p>That effort may ultimately be at odds with the more idle audience Peek&#8217;s creators are apparently aiming for, although the app&#8217;s gestural dare and flare &#8212; and purist good looks &#8212; will undoubtedly push the buttons of tech aesthetes and attract a style-conscious app-using niche. So Peek may well get cachet, even if it doesn&#8217;t manage huge reach.</p>
<p>And if the app&#8217;s underlying aim is to plant a flag that puts Square Mountains on the map, and illustrates the calibre of design work this startup is capable of turning out, then Peek will probably have done more than enough work for one day.</p>

As TechCrunch previously reported, a hacker claimed to have gained the Twitter user&#8217;s last four credit card digits from PayPal, which was then used to convince GoDaddy to reset their account. The compromised GoDaddy account &#8212; and its requisite domain collection &#8212; was used as leverage to extort the user out of their excellent Twitter account, @N. In the wake of the hacking and ensuing outrage over lax security, denials of culpability, TechCrunch wondered out loud why Twitter itself hadn&#8217;t made @N whole. We spoke to @N, known to most as Naoki Hiroshima, after the fact and and he detailed a few things that GoDaddy should do to tighten its security, methods that might have helped protect his account: &#8220;[Two factor authentication] can&#8217;t prevent this from happening again,&#8221; says Hiroshima. &#8220;GoDaddy allowed the guy to reset everything over the phone. As long as a company only uses the last 4 digits of a [credit card] to verify [identity], this will keep happening. They should ask multiple questions.&#8221; GoDaddy has made steps that mirror what Hiroshima felt was needed. In a tweet today, the company said the following: @N_is_stolen Will do. We now require 8 card digits, lock after 3 attempts and deal with 2-factor authentication accounts differently. ^NF Requiring more credit card digits matters. If the hacker in question had been required to provide that quantity of information, the jig would have been up prematurely: The hacker claims that PayPal gave them the last four digits of Hiroshima&#8217;s credit card. If the GoDaddy threshold had been higher, we wouldn&#8217;t be talking about this now. It&#8217;s a bummer that GoDaddy was able to be compromised in the above way, but the new security policies should reduce future risk for its customers, of which I am one. I&#8217;ve reached out to GoDaddy for an explanation of the changes to its security policies and will update this post when I hear back.

<p>In many of the old war movies, every elite unit has at least one member that has the critical talent to make something out of nothing: <i>the scrounge</i>. You know this guy: when everyone is out of rations or ammunition and the truck is broken down, he quietly heads out. The next day, when all hope of completing the mission seems lost, the scrounge comes rolling up in a freshly repainted jeep, full rations, ammo, and, stereotypically, a case of cold beer. How did he do that? Where did it all come from? &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask,&#8221; he growls, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get movin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harvey Keitel&#8217;s Winston &#8220;The Wolf&#8221; Wolfe in <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is another iconic fix-it guy. He comes directly from a party in his tux to &#8220;clean up&#8221; the situation. I love his &#8220;Can I get some coffee?&#8221; calm demeanor as he carefully assesses the situation, starts prioritizing, and then takes swift action to get Jules and Vincent out of their blood-soaked jam.</p>
<p>During a crux scene in <i>Apollo 13, </i>the engineers in Houston realize they have to somehow fit the Command Module&#8217;s square carbon dioxide filter in the Lunar Module&#8217;s round receptacles if they want everyone to keep breathing. They got together in a room, dumped the box of materials available to the astronauts on the table and said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what we have to work with…&#8221; After working for a tense few hours, they cobbled together a solution with step-by-step instructions for the oxygen-starved astronauts. That scene always gives me goose bumps.</p>
<p>All of the successful entrepreneurs I know are part-scrounge, part-Wolf, with a good dose of calm-under-pressure space jockey thrown in. In other words, they are ridiculously resourceful. It&#8217;s this magical combination of wicked-smart, tenacious as hell, works harder and longer than most people think is humanly possible, thinks way outside the box and is also unbelievably passionate and compelling. In short, they have special tools to just get shit done.</p>
<p>Special, but not unobtainable.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve noticed some patterns and methods that explain how great people manage to pull off the impossible. And with Mr. Wolfe&#8217;s permission, here they are:</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Crack the egg with a sledgehammer.&#8221;</b> This was a quote from my VP of Engineering, Nawaf Bitar, at IronPort. When IronPort anti-spam wasn&#8217;t working and it looked like our partner Brightmail was going to terminate our contract, we had a complete &#8220;Oh shit!&#8221; moment. Nawaf moved the <b>entire</b> engineering team over to work on it. He called them all in to work nights and weekends until it was fixed, and urgently sought out every anti-spam expert on the planet to help or to hire. Other people would have done one or two of those things &#8211; he did them all simultaneously and immediately. Nawaf saved our bacon.</p>
<p><b>Set a measurable goal and brainstorm like hell</b><strong>.</strong> When we were developing our first product at IronPort, we desperately needed to get feedback from email administrators at large companies. Our dream was to quickly talk to 50 of them to get to a critical mass, but how the hell do you do that when you don&#8217;t know any? We brainstormed, tested, stalked, and leaned on our networks. We made a list of the Fortune 500 and tried to line up anyone we knew on the inside. We all went through our school alumni networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you introduce me to someone who runs your email? Who do you call when email goes sideways?&#8221; Everyone we did get through to was pumped for information to get to more: &#8220;What conferences do you go to? What do you read? Who else can you introduce us to?&#8221; We reached 43 of the exact right people &#8212; not quite 50, but it did the trick.</p>
<p><b>Cheat time</b><strong>.</strong> During a board meeting last year, Quirky&#8217;s CEO Ben Kaufman recounted a story about preparing for a critical Home Depot meeting. Quirky was just starting to build things for the &#8220;connected home&#8221; and Home Depot was a dream opportunity. When he got the call in New York one afternoon that the home improvement giant could squeeze him into a new product-review meeting the very next day in Atlanta, he brought nearly the whole company in for an all-night prep session. They split up into five different teams and came up with seven working products &#8212; overnight. They packed up prototypes of a Wi-Fi-enabled mousetrap, garage opener, smoke detector and water sensor, among others, and then slept on the flight down. A month later, Home Depot ordered $7 million worth of products.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Insanely violent passion.&#8221;</b> This is a phrase that I&#8217;ve heard used to describe Andrew Rubin, the CEO of Illumio. Andrew came out to Silicon Valley from the Midwest with virtually no connections. Within 18 months he raised two rounds of capital and hired one of the best leadership teams I&#8217;ve ever seen. How did he do it? Andrew &#8220;glows in the dark.&#8221; He is so charismatic, compelling, logical, and excited about what he is pursing that you can just feel the energy &#8212; even see it glow. Getting to the right person often requires a series of small baton passes or jumping from lily pads of different people to get to your destination.</p>
<p>Andrew was unrelenting  when it came to asking for suggestions and pursuing connections and introductions from just about everyone. And since he came across so passionate and compelling, people actually felt like they were building social capital by helping him.</p>
<p><b>Foot squarely on the line. </b>I wouldn&#8217;t suggest that being resourceful has anything to do with doing something illegal or unethical, but I&#8217;ve definitely noticed a pattern of being &#8220;creative.&#8221; When my then head of sales, Shrey Bhatia, was trying to close a $900,000 purchase order from DoubleClick in New York, he called up the CIO and said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ll be in New York tomorrow, could I drop by for 15 minutes to discuss this?&#8221; Of course, he had no intention of going to New York unless the CIO confirmed the meeting. When the CIO finally did, at around 7 p.m., Shrey turned his car around, jumped on the red-eye, slept on the plane and brought home the order the next day. We had the check framed.</p>
<p><i>Pulp Fiction</i>&#8217;s Winston Wolfe is obviously a fictional character, but the stereotype he represents is worth exploring. A guy that&#8217;s seen it all, he&#8217;s completely unflappable, methodical and decisive. How did he get that way? Like an old sea captain, he is the sum of so many hard-earned life experiences of living on the edge.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no substitute for real experience, I believe it helps to hear and share stories of resourcefulness in action &#8212; almost like case studies in school. With every new account, we open our mind to a new path to take and learn the tactics that others have used to overcome much larger obstacles than the ones that are currently in front of us. I&#8217;d love to hear about more &#8220;great moments in resourcefulness&#8221; in the comments section.</p>

The selling point of the Boombot REX is that it can stand up to mud, dust and some water exposure, as well as take spills, while providing quality sound, portability and also speaker phone functions, including the ability to use Siri on the iPhone from the gadget. Its audio sync tech was designed to be an answer to user requests to broadcast to multiple speakers at once, which isn&#8217;t supported with standard Bluetooth.

With fresh funding, perhaps that kind of expansion is exactly what&#8217;s in store.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:115:"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/01/boombotix-raises-4m-for-its-wearable-action-speakers-and-audio-sync-software/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:2:{s:7:"content";a:3:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:64:"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_9543.jpg";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";s:6:"medium";s:5:"image";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"Boombotix%20Raises%20%244M%20For%20Its%20Wearable%20Action%20Speakers%20And%20Audio%20Sync%26nbsp%3BSoftware";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:7:"

In an App Store first, an indie game developer from Hanoi, Vietnam, Nguyen Ha Dong, has 3 apps in the top 10 rankings right now, which is not only odd because the publisher has seemingly come out of nowhere with these viral hits, but also because there&#8217;s no cross-promotion built into the games themselves. The other two titles, Super Ball Juggling (currently #2) and Shuriken Block (#6) instead seem to be benefitting solely from the word-of-mouth success of #1 free app, Flappy Bird itself. As for the Flappy Bird game, its deceptively simple appearance with graphics that harken back to the era of 8-bit gaming, is actually one of the hardest games you&#8217;ll ever play. And yet the gameplay involves nothing more than tapping your screen to keep a flying bird from running into green pipes that look like they&#8217;ve been snatched out of Super Mario Bros. Yes, that&#8217;s the extent of it. There&#8217;s no other challenge or story. But good luck, gamers, because if you can get a score in the double digits, you&#8217;re some kind of god here. In fact, it&#8217;s a game that&#8217;s so irritatingly impossible, and yet somehow so addictive, that it seems like it&#8217;s been designed more so to have its players run to tell their friends about it, rather than master the skill set it requires. (Though some, of course, have done that too.) After the hundredth time you play it, having only a score of, say, five, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re unable to keep quiet about the darned thing. A simple built-in &#8220;Rate&#8221; button, one of only a few in the game besides &#8220;Start,&#8221; &#8220;Score,&#8221; and a pause button which you&#8217;ll probably die if you try to use, allows you to share your frustrations on the app store, while its &#8220;Share&#8221; counterpart helpfully lets you tell your friends on Facebook, Twitter, SMS or email. &#8220;This sucks! You have to try it,&#8221; is how those invites generally read. The game is not for everyone, to be clear. It&#8217;s kind of an awful little thing that you can even play in spare chunks of time when you only have seconds (maybe not even minutes!) to kill in between some other activity.

<p>To date, some 300,000 users have rated Flappy Bird, many leaving lengthy reviews with suggestions, requests, and general venting: &#8220;The only reason why I have not yet deleted this horrid game is the overwhelming sense of relief and accomplishment I feel when I finally beat a high score,&#8221; writes one. &#8220;I assume this feeling will soon consume you, too, but don&#8217;t say you were never warned.&#8221; &#8220;Let me start by saying DO NOT download flappy bird&#8230;People warned me about it, but I didn&#8217;t care,&#8221; wrote another. &#8220;My life is over. Your life is over. The world is over,&#8221; said a third with dramatic flair.</p>
<p>So now the question is, who the heck made this thing? And why did it get so popular?</p>
<p>What we do know is that game developer 29-year old Nguyen Ha Dong runs an indie game studio called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dotgears.com/">.GEARS</a> based in Vietnam. (This appears to be true, given that the site is <a target="_blank" href="http://whois.domaintools.com/dotgears.com">registered</a> to someone with the same name in Hanoi, Vietnam.) He says he&#8217;s been making games for four years. Explains the website, &#8220;mostly, we&#8217;re making arcade games that are bite-sized, take no more than a few minutes of playing right on smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>Our work is heavily influenced by retro pixellated games in its golden age. Everything is pure, extremely hard and incredibly fun to play.&#8221; So yes, they <em>actually</em> mean to frustrate you to the point of insanity, in case you weren&#8217;t sure. Beyond that, Dong is intent on avoiding publicity, which of course, adds to the mystery surrounding Flappy Bird. He has turned down several requests for interviews, and when we sent over some questions about his background, he replied &#8220;I&#8217;m not comfortable with being exposed.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">Dong&#8217;s internet presence has been fairly low-key until now. He has a </span><a>Twitter</a><span style="line-height:1.625;"> account, and has hung around on</span><a> HTML5gamedevs.com</a><span style="line-height:1.625;">, discussing development. But the </span><a>.GEARS</a><span style="line-height:1.625;"> site is pretty basic, with no mention of who&#8217;s behind the games, or what they&#8217;re all about.</span></p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch via email, Dong says he&#8217;s the sole creator at .GEARS. He explains that the programming in Flappy Bird took 2-3 days to complete, and he reused artwork from other titles. &#8220;.GEARS is not a company,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;It is just myself now but I have to use term &#8216;we&#8217; to prepare for changes in the future. Before &#8216;Flappy Bird&#8217;, none of my games have 1/100th of that popularity.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Charts To Die For (And Die For, And Die For, And Die For)</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Dong remains semi-anonymous, mobile developers and marketers are going crazy over the game&#8217;s app store charts. How did a title, released back in May 2013, end up at the top of the App Store? When and how did the viral effects kick in?</p>
<p>Well, the &#8220;when&#8221; part can be more easily answered, thanks to resources like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.appannie.com/">App Annie</a>. Sometime around the beginning of this year, the app stopped its usual rise and fall pattern, and hit the top charts in Family, Games and Overall.</p>
<p>And there it has stuck. The game is ad-supported, and built using Dong&#8217;s own framework on iOS and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.andengine.org/">AndEngine</a> on Android, he explained on Twitter. The ads run at the top of Flappy Bird, but the game doesn&#8217;t directly point users to Dong&#8217;s other titles.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-950901" alt="Screen Shot 2014-01-31 at 5.20.01 PM" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/screen-shot-2014-01-31-at-5-20-01-pm.png?w=640&#038;h=436" width="640" height="436" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-950900" alt="Screen Shot 2014-01-31 at 5.20.15 PM" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/screen-shot-2014-01-31-at-5-20-15-pm.png?w=640&#038;h=427" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>As for &#8220;how&#8221; Flappy Bird went viral, that&#8217;s a bit murkier. Flappy Bird is getting 2-3 million downloads per day on iOS and Android, Dong tells us. But the game doesn&#8217;t have the hallmarks of a paid promotion &#8211; that is, a top position achieved though ads or paid downloads. Dong, answering questions on Twitter, claims this, too.</p>
<p>In response to someone wondering if Flappy Bird&#8217;s success is really organic, he writes: &#8220;It is hard to believe, I understand. I have no resources to do anything else beside uploading the game.&#8221; He also says the Flappy Bird Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts are not his. &#8220;The popularity could be my luck,&#8221; he <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thechocolatelabapps.com/how-to-make-flappy-bird/">said</a> to Chocolate Lab Apps, during an interview.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thechocolatelabapps.com/is-twitter-the-fuel-behind-the-success-of-the-1-app-flappy-bird/">Chocolate Lab Apps</a>&#8216; Elaine Heney suggests that writing the &#8216;best&#8217; review of Flappy Bird may have even become a &#8216;sport&#8217; of sorts. People are competing to write the most ridiculous and descriptive reviews of the frustrating game &#8212; leading to a stream of reviews that <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Flappy+Bird+Review&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime">utilizing the #flappybird hashtag on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>He reconfirms this to TechCrunch, adding, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how my games can be so popular. Most of my players are kids in schools. I would like to thanks them for playing my game and sharing it to other people.&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/blog/flappy-birds-smoke-mirrors-scamming-app-store/">Others are more skeptical</a>, saying basically, there&#8217;s no way these games could go viral the way they did, especially because of their age.</p>
<p>As for the games&#8217; difficulty, Dong claims that in his games, there are no impossible situations that players cannot pass. &#8220;In all my games, the score of Platinum Medal was my best score when I released the apps,&#8221; he tell us.</p>
<p>The tip, he notes, is to not push &#8220;too hard and too fast.&#8221; Going forward, Dong says he plans to update Flappy Bird, Super Ball Juggling, and Shuriken Block right now.

<p>I can&#8217;t think of a buzzier phrase in the tech industry these days than &#8220;growth hacking,&#8221; and in some ways I also can&#8217;t think of a more dangerous trend to glom onto. Sure, growth is good. But only if it&#8217;s real growth.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a marketing campaign that goes viral and wins you a bunch of one-time &#8220;users,&#8221; it can actually do more harm than good. If it&#8217;s a product that is growing through spammy unsolicited social &#8220;sharing,&#8221; the growth numbers will massively misrepresent the health of the business. The really great growth hackers out there &#8212; people like Andy Johns, who helped Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Quora all reach record user numbers &#8212; understand that it&#8217;s not just about getting as many users as possible, but about helping to get the product experience right and ultimately amassing as large a user base as possible. Those are two very different things.</p>
<p>Take what happened with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/formspring">Formspring</a> as an example. In 2010, the Q&amp;A site experienced the fastest growth of any site ever (as its top brass were <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/02/08/formspring-beat-pinterest-to-10-million-active-users-by-months/">quick to point out</a> on Twitter when TechCrunch awarded that honor to Pinterest last year). But within a year that growth had trailed off and eventually the site traffic/usage began to decline. Why? Because of its integration with social media sites, Formspring was able to generate rapid growth, but once visitors had taken a look at the site once or twice, they realized that there was very little value in the underlying product and, as a result, the vast majority of &#8220;users&#8221; that touched the site didn&#8217;t ever come back or engage in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>I am starting to fear that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zynga">Zynga</a> is destined to be another such example: They did well early on by leveraging very aggressive viral marketing techniques and combining them with what was, at the time, cutting edge in-game monetization. However, it appears to me that the company has lacked something that I always look for as an investor: Product Soul. By that I mean a founder&#8217;s vision for the products he or she wants the company to create, a strong belief in the product&#8217;s ability to change the lives of its users for the better, and an unrelenting focus on making those products great and easy to use.</p>
<p><img src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/rocket2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="rocket2" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-951179" />For Zynga, this has never been the case. The focus on growth and lack of true product innovation (the company has largely been one that has created knock-offs of other games) has resulted in a company that appears to lack real direction and whose relevance has largely faded over the past year.</p>
<p>Social video app <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/viddy">Viddy</a> is an even better examples. It was jockeying with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/socialcam">Socialcam</a> and others to be &#8220;the Instagram of video&#8221; in early 2012 and its growth appeared to be exceptional. From May 2011 to March 2012, the company registered 10 million users, and by May 2012 it had 30 million. By December 2012, it had 40 million registered, but only 675,000 monthly users.</p>
<p>In a six-month span the company&#8217;s growth plummeted 95 percent, not just because Facebook cracked down on spammy apps that required users to install them in order to view content, but because the underlying product didn&#8217;t resonate with consumers from an ongoing usage standpoint. As a result, tens of millions of users had &#8220;tried&#8221; Viddy and were left with an underwhelming experience. As any good entrepreneur will tell you, it&#8217;s much harder to acquire a user a second time after a bad product experience than it is to acquire them the first time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no inherent problem with growth hacking, of course. Growth is great and ultimately can be a big driver of enterprise value. The problem is that right now, far too many entrepreneurs are focused more on that than they are on what I believe to be the most important thing of all and, ultimately a more successful driver of sustained growth: When a user touches a product, do they love it? Do they come back and use it again? And, overall, do they have a good experience with it?</p>
<p>I recently had an entrepreneur that I really respect talk to me about the fact that he was considering hiring a growth hacker. They have a strong team, a great company mission and are the early leaders in a large addressable market with a product that is attempting to solve a major pain point for a set of users. But they have a growth problem. Why? First, their early growth has been driven by marketing spend as opposed to organic growth. And second, the vast majority of users who have tried the product aren&#8217;t engaging with it on an ongoing basis (even though the product is designed for repeat usage).</p>
<p>Those are two key issues for me, and ones I don&#8217;t think a growth hacker can fix. When evaluating the &#8220;quality of growth&#8221; early on in a company, I look for companies that are growing largely through organic channels (in other words, 85 to 90 percent or more of growth is being driven by free channels). That sort of growth tends to mean that users are choosing to tell others about how great a product is. I also look at a company&#8217;s engagement metrics over time to see if users are trying a product or service out once and leaving, or if they&#8217;re choosing to engage with the product over and over again.</p>
<p>Given what I heard from this entrepreneur, I strongly suggested that he improve both word-of-mouth endorsements and user engagement before trying to accelerate growth. Once the product is growing organically, and users are voluntarily engaging with it on an ongoing basis, then, sure, by all means hire a growth hacker to help ramp things up.</p>
<p><img src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/rocket3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="rocket3" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-951181" />The problem right now is that many companies seem to be operating under the total misconception that growth fixes all. That leads them to bring on self-proclaimed &#8220;growth hackers&#8221; who rapidly acquire more customers through spammy viral techniques, but when those customers don&#8217;t engage, or &#8212; worse &#8212; have bad experiences and tell their friends about it, that growth curve crashes. By that point your growth hacker is on to his or her next gig, and you&#8217;re left with what you had to begin with: a product that either hasn&#8217;t found its audience yet or hasn&#8217;t yet given people a reason to engage with it.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re thinking about hiring a growth hacker, find someone who&#8217;s a great product person and who really knows user experience and understands user value, not just someone who knows all the tricks to ratcheting up your growth curve.</p>

Be still your beating hearts.</p>
<p>But admit it: secretly you want to know about the success/failure of the myriad news sources whose stories flit disconnectedly across your Facebook and Twitter feeds from time to time, if only so you can tell your friends that you already knew who was doomed, on the day that long-fabled Great Shakeout finally comes and half of the world&#8217;s journalists find themselves surplus to needs.</p>
<p>Old media! Right? Newspapers, magazines, and even, eventually, television: those shambling dinosaurs will be eaten alive by nimble new-media mammals, obsoleted by customized news feeds like Flipboard and Pulse and Feedly and Facebook&#8217;s new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/30/facebook-paper/">Paper</a>. As our collective news diet is slowly but inexorably shaped ever more by our social media feeds, rather than the TV channels we watch or the newspaper(s) we read, their audience will turn away from them and leave them to die. You&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>And yet I am the proud possessor of some interesting data which indicates that the world is, as always, to some extent at least, more nuanced and complex than that. I&#8217;m talking about my pet social-sharing tool <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/">Scanvine</a>, which I built last year* to track, measure, and rank how often news stories from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/sources">a panoply of sources</a> are shared on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn. Scanvine now has a whole year of data under its belt, which points in some interesting directions.</p>
<p>A whole lot of old-media sources are stagnating, it&#8217;s true. I give you the BBC World feed&#8230;</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/bbc-world/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950832" alt="bbc" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/bbc.png?w=1024&#038;h=302" width="1024" height="302" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;which is plenty jagged, but clearly shows a slow decline in shares-per-story over the course of 2013. (The red line counts average shares per story, the blue line how many stories Scanvine tracked.) The same <i>was</i> true for Fox News:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/fox-news/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950833" alt="fox" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fox.png?w=1024&#038;h=297" width="1024" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;at least until the week of December 2, after which there was a noticeable uptick. Hmm. What could possibly have happened that week?</p>
<p>Oh, right. December 2, 2013: &#8216;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/02/facebook-news-discovery-2/">Facebook&#8217;s Feed Adds More Links And &#8220;Related Articles&#8221; To Battle News Discovery Apps</a>.&#8217; And boom, all the major TV networks benefit &#8212; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/abc-news/2013/Week?show=shares">ABC</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/cbs-news/2013/Week?show=shares">CBS</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/nbc-news/2013/Week?show=shares">NBC</a> all spiked near the end of the year. NBC less so, admittedly &#8230; but then, they were the only one of the Big Four who had been thriving already. It seems Facebook&#8217;s new feed gave a shot in the arm to some organizations who hadn&#8217;t quite figured out social media for themselves.</p>
<p>Will that really matter in the long run, though? All of those graphs are still essentially flat. Consider those old-media mavens who <em>are</em> thriving on social media, like The Atlantic:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/the-atlantic/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950834" alt="atlantic" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/atlantic.png?w=1024&#038;h=296" width="1024" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>And above all, CNN who, to my considerable surprise, boast the second-highest shares-per-story average of any news source that Scanvine tracks:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/cnn/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950835" alt="cnn" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/cnn.png?w=1024&#038;h=300" width="1024" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s legitimately impressive &#8212; until you compare the slope of that graph to, say, TMZ:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/tmz/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950864" alt="tmz" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/tmz.png?w=1024&#038;h=298" width="1024" height="298" /></a></p>
<p>Or most of all, BuzzFeed:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/buzzfeed/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950836" alt="buzzfeed" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/buzzfeed.png?w=1024&#038;h=303" width="1024" height="303" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s up with that anomalous dip at the end of the year, but that graph as a whole is <i>insane</i>. But still more sensible than <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/source/upworthy/2013/Week?show=shares">Upworthy</a>, which doesn&#8217;t just top Scanvine&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/sources">source leaderboard</a>, it <i>dominates</i> it to such an extent that I actually thought there was some kind of bug in my code until their pre-eminence was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/12/i-thought-i-knew-how-big-upworthy-was-on-facebook-then-i-saw-this/282203/">confirmed by NewsWhip.</a> (Which does what Scanvine does, sort of, albeit in a paid and slightly less idiosyncratic way.)</p>
<p>So. My data indicates that a) old-media sources are thriving b) some new-media sources are <i>really</i> thriving. (Other examples: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/business-insider/2013/Week?show=shares">Business Insider</a> and, I&#8217;m very pleased to say, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/techcrunch/2013/Week?show=shares">TechCrunch</a>.) But not everyone can win. People may be reading more news than ever, but there are still only so many eyeballs to go around. So who&#8217;s losing?</p>
<p>Guess what? It&#8217;s not just old media. My data says that once-mighty Gawker saw a slight but distinct decline over the course of 2013:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/gawker/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950837" alt="gawker" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/gawker.png?w=1024&#038;h=295" width="1024" height="295" /></a></p>
<p>As did Jezebel:</p>

<p>And in the world of tech news, which I know best, some former giants have developed feet of clay. <i>Wired</i>, in particular, has seen far better days:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/wired/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950839" alt="wired" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wired.png?w=1024&#038;h=298" width="1024" height="298" /></a></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s hard not to feel sorry for poor <em>PandoDaily</em>, which seems to have essentially flatlined at a mere 100 social shares per story:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/pando-daily/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950840" alt="pando" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/pando.png?w=1024&#038;h=296" width="1024" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>Though on the other end of the spectrum, credit where it&#8217;s due, <em>The Verge</em> has had a spectacular year.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/the-verge/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950841" alt="verge" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/verge.png?w=1024&#038;h=297" width="1024" height="297" /></a></p>
<p><i>So what does this all mean, Jon?</i> I imagine you inquiring. Funny you should ask. I just might have an answer or two.</p>
<p><b>1. New media rises and falls much faster than old media. That bodes ill for the latter.</b></p>
<p>What happens in the future is all about the rate of change today, and counting shares on social media seems a pretty good way to measure that rate of change. Television, newspapers, magazines &#8212; your <i>CNN</i>s, your <i>New York Times</i>, your <i>New Yorker</i>s &#8212; appear to have enormous momentum, meaning that their social readerships rise and fall only slowly. External forces like Facebook&#8217;s news-feed tweaks can influence this, but only a little.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a factor of sheer size, either; BuzzFeed pieces already get many more social-media shares than do most so-called &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media sources, and yet their share counts just kept on skyrocketing all through last year. Rather, the so-called &#8220;new media&#8221; tend to rise &#8212; but also fall &#8212; much faster than the old. I can&#8217;t help but wonder whether <em>Upworthy</em>, in particular, will be here today but gone tomorrow.</p>
<p>So will we see a few new-media titans rise to stand with <i>The Economist</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, etc., and dominate the landscape for many years? Or will those colossi totter and collapse like Ozymandias, only to be replaced by an endless series of flashes in the pan, as new generations of media organizations just keep on evolving and emerging, faster and faster, each one devouring the previous?</p>
<p>I think the answer is staring us in the face, one way or another: and I think its name is BuzzFeed. Immensely successful, hugely popular, everyone&#8217;s favorite source of online GIF listicles has quietly diversified to some impressive international and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/media/buzzfeed-hires-pulitzer-winner-to-head-investigative-unit.html">investigative news</a>, as well as video. If BuzzFeed thrives and prospers, then we&#8217;re witnessing the rise of a new generation of titans; but if they fail and wither, if they are out-Buzzfed by something newer and hotter and hipper and catchier, then we&#8217;re seeing the news industry as we know it descend into an endless thrashing maelstrom of mayflies competing desperately for attention from an ever-more-fickle audience before they, in turn, are devoured. Let&#8217;s hope for the former.</p>
<p><b>2. Permeable paywalls are probably a pretty good idea.</b></p>
<p>One other striking thing about Scanvine&#8217;s data: every single source that Scanvine tracks, without exception, has a shares-per-story distribution which looks something like this:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/bbc-world/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950851" alt="bbc-dist" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/bbc-dist.png?w=1024&#038;h=297" width="1024" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.scanvine.com/leaderboard/Source/techcrunch/2013/Week?show=shares"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-950852" alt="tc-dist" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/tc-dist.png?w=1024&#038;h=293" width="1024" height="293" /></a></p>
<p>In other words, all online news follows a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a>: The scaling exponents may vary, but the fundamental distribution remains the same. A small number of viral articles get most of the attention, a long tail gets little to none, and the decay from the former to the latter is described by a surprisingly smooth curve.</p>
<p>This means that allowing readers to view N articles/month for free, but requiring them to pay a modicum to see the rest, makes good business sense. Your viral articles still go viral, so you attract most of the free eyeballs you would have anyway, while your long tail makes money from subscribers. How big should N be? Well, that depends &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8211; but this assumes, of course, that you can get anybody to pay you at all, which is a neat trick when there are a zillion other free news sources out there. And how do they pay for themselves? Via advertising, which is really only lucrative if you have a wealthy and highly targeted market like sports or tech news &#8212; or via sponsored content, such as&#8230;yep, you guessed it. BuzzFeed. So will the future be sponsored or paywalled? Again, for the answer, look to them.</p>
<p>And watch very carefully. Because if I&#8217;m right, they are the future of news in miniature, in real time, right here before us, as we witness it. No pressure, all y&#8217;all over there: but please don&#8217;t screw it up.</p>
<p>*Completely singlehandedly, he muttered modestly, right down to its Android/iOS apps. And its UX design. Which explains its UX design, in case you were wondering.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/01/buzzfeed-is-the-future/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:2:{s:7:"content";a:16:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:70:"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/buzzfeed-video.png";s:4:"type";s:9:"image/png";s:6:"medium";s:5:"image";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"BuzzFeed%20Is%20The%20Future%20%28Whether%20It%20Lives%20Or%26nbsp%3BDies%29";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:7:"

The latest to join the list of potential targets is Simplify360, a Bangalore-based social media analytics startup that counts over 100 paying customers including big names such as Yamaha, Revlon, Target and Wipro. I reached out to Bhupendra Khanal, the startup&#8217;s CEO, who confirmed ongoing talks for strategic investments with several companies, but declined to elaborate any further. This is what he had to say: &#8220;At this stage I cannot accept or decline this news. Several companies have approached for strategic investment or acquisition, and serious talks are on. We will announce if something materializes.&#8221; The rumors of Adobe being in talks to acquire Simplify360 were reported by Indian social media blog, Socialsamosa yesterday. Simplify360 is among a growing breed of startups focused on gathering and parsing data from Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms. A recent, notable acquisition in this space was that of Topsy, which was acquired by Apple for over $200 million last year. Simplify360 is similar to Topsy, except that it goes beyond Twitter and crawls through terabytes of data that include Tweets, Facebook posts, etc., to offer customized analytics. Founded in January 2009, Simplify360 has been bootstrapped so far with an undisclosed angel investment from Amvensys Capital in December 2012. The startup has 25 people on its payroll, and it currently sifts through around 5 million posts and tweets every day that generates around 5 terabytes of data every week. Another key differentiator for Simplify360 is that it now offers analytics in over 27 languages and has customers in markets like Korea apart from India, where around one-third of 200 million Internet users are increasingly posting social media conversations in over 30 languages. So why would an Adobe or WPP be interested in this little, unknown startup based in Bangalore? From what I gathered after speaking with several people in companies that could be potential acquirers, converting millions of Tweets and social media posts into real insights is the Holy Grail for marketeers, and tools such as Simplify360 help achieve that. As this blog notes, Adobe&#8217;s interest also comes from the fact that it really wants to compete with Salesforce better, especially in the social media analytics space.

<p>As <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.aakarpost.com/2014/01/adobe-to-acquire-simplify360.html">this blog notes</a>, Adobe&#8217;s interest also comes from the fact that it really wants to compete with Salesforce better, especially in the social media analytics space. Both Salesforce and Oracle have been doubling down on their social media analytics strategy through acquisitions. While <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/04/salesforce-lines-up-against-oracle-on-social-push-buys-buddy-media-for-689m/">Salesforce bought Buddy Media in 2012</a>, Oracle acquired several companies <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/05/oracle-buys-collective-intelligence/">including Vitrue and Collective Intellect</a>.</p>
<p>Simplify360 founders and officials at companies in talks with the startup declined to share details on revenues, valuation or anything related. The startup makes money by offering its SaaS analytics tool for a monthly subscription starting at $500.</p>
<p>&#8220;The startup is profitable and should be able to decide on the strategic alliance or acquisition within 2-3 months,&#8221; a source familiar with the discussions said. He added that an investment banking firm has already been appointed.</p>
<p>Whether Adobe or somebody big finally acquires Simplify360 or not, it&#8217;s increasingly becoming clear that Indian startups have started getting attention of potential acquirers. As we wrote this piece about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/little-eye-labs-acquisition/">Little Eye Labs acquisition by Facebook</a> recently, startups in big data space including <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/02/as-facebook-eyes-up-little-eye-labs-twitter-is-also-looking-at-a-startup-in-india/">Frrole are showing up on radars of Twitter</a> and several others.</p>

<p>Alternative Commerce is a piece of cake, right? After all, while big box retailers are suffering, fun things like &#8220;the Internet&#8221; and &#8220;mobile phones&#8221; make it easier to sell stuff to customers without the expense of stores and make a bunch of money. Just ask WebVan, Kozmo, eToys.com, or Pets.com. Okay maybe it isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> easy.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, even in the alternative commerce world, you still have to create, market, sell and deliver an actual product to consumers and make money in the process. <span style="line-height:1.625;">That&#8217;s the rub. If you build a product, make sure your customers come and make sure it makes money. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">Don&#8217;t fret and refocus your attention on the next &#8220;app&#8221; or creating the next &#8220;SaaS business.&#8221; </span><span style="line-height:1.625;">Follow your alternative commerce dream, but also follow a few simple rules &#8212; many of which come down to business fundamentals &#8212; and you, too, can create a great company that doesn&#8217;t just ship products but focuses on creative business models, alternative distribution channels, brand and loving your customer. With the right recipe, it can indeed be a piece of cake.</span></p>

I am an early investor in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/the-honest-company">The Honest Company</a> (next-generation consumer products for babies/kids/families), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/naturebox">NatureBox</a> (subscription healthy snack product delivered to your door), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/listia">Listia</a> (the largest barter marketplace), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/stylesaint">StyleSaint</a> (an online fashion brand that creates product based on social interaction/input) and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/plum-district">Plum District</a> (deals for moms).</p>
<p>The reason we invested in these companies is simple: the teams. The basic tenet of a successful alternative commerce company (or any early-stage business) is to start with great people. Get your key chefs in place before you preheat your oven and get cooking.</p>
<p><b>2) Mix Together Your Product and Customer</b></p>
<p>This is the part of the recipe where you can really get your creative juices flowing. Here are a few of the key ingredients.</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter">Net Promoter Score</a>. </strong>First introduced by Fred Reichheld in a 2003 Harvard Business Review piece, this can&#8217;t be more simple. The basic idea is to ask, How likely are you to recommend this product, company or service to your friends or colleagues? That&#8217;s it. This basic and fundamental idea is all that really matters. When this became clear to our firm a few years ago, it made clear why we believed in companies like Honest, Warby Parker, etc. &#8211; people loved what they were doing. When it comes to product, nothing else matters. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Solving a Problem.</strong> Are you solving a problem or making something easier, e.g. not having to go to a store? Google Express, eBay Now and Amazon are making logistics and visits to the store easier (and getting a lot of information in the process!). You can compete with them and get blown out of the water or actually solve a problem they can&#8217;t. Create healthier products, deliver a differentiated service, build something special, delight your customers. If you don&#8217;t, they win.</p>
<p><strong>Brand.</strong> Building a brand is hard. There are folks like Michael Kors and LuLulemon who have built amazing brands in the last few years (Kors has been a fashion icon for 20+ years) in the public markets. If you don&#8217;t want to build a brand, don&#8217;t try alternative commerce. Don&#8217;t. Walk away. People need to know you, need to love you, need to want you and have a personal connection to the brand. The only way to increase margins and grow a business is to own a brand. If you are selling someone else&#8217;s brand, you are dead.</p>
<p><b>3) Bake in business model and financials</b></p>
<p>No matter how delicious the ingredients are, the cake will not come out right unless you have the right temperature, cooking time, etc. Some key metrics to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Business Model.</strong> The reason I call this alternative commerce and not e-commerce is that if you sell things online that exist in the offline/online world, you are dead. The margins will continue to drop until you can&#8217;t be profitable. Sure, you can try to get a better deal with UPS or FedEx but it won&#8217;t matter. You can try to get more margin from the manufacturer but someone will do better. If you&#8217;re not Amazon, you will lose. We all learned this with Pets.com in the first version of the web but people don&#8217;t remember. If you keep selling widgets that are available at Target or on Amazon you will lose.</p>
<p><strong>Margins.</strong> When it comes to new alternative commerce ventures, if you sell product that has low margins, you will fail. Over time, other entrants will enter and your margins will drop even lower. Sell high-margin products (build a brand, have unique channels, offer high margin product). It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p><strong>Customer acquisition.</strong> If you need Google and Facebook to acquire customers you are in a heap of trouble. The &#8220;crack&#8221; seems really great for a while because of the economics but over time those economics will change. In fact, we have seen they usually flip. If you pay for your traffic, other people will fast follow and that&#8217;s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Customer acquisition cost/lifetime value.</strong> When we started investing in alternative commerce 14 years ago, we thought it was a metrics-driven business. It is not &#8211; you need a team, killer product and brand. The numbers change the longer you stay in the business. That said, the cost to acquire a customer and the lifetime value of a customer are important.</p>
<p>If your CAC to LTV is 2-4X (i.e. it costs $10 to acquire and it pays back 20-40 before folks churn) don&#8217;t keep going. One issue is you need to acquire. The other issue is that you are too close to the sun when acquisition increases. We tend to focus on 5X+ businesses. We may be wrong but I would rather be wrong here.</p>
<p>These are the basic building blocks of my favorite recipe &#8211; no secret sauce here. In fact, all of the ingredients for success in alternative commerce are really the same fundamentals that have held true for years when building a business. The good news for new entrants is that the big box retailers are dead or dying. If you want to disrupt them, build an amazing product and brand that solves a real problem for your consumers and reaches them in a creative way. It&#8217;s a piece of cake, right?</p>

Its long-suffering deal with Microsoft has underperformed, making <a target="_blank" href="http://recode.net/2014/01/31/with-fast-break-and-curveball-mayer-is-aiming-to-bring-back-search-tech-to-yahoo/">recent revelations</a> that the company is working on building new search products hardly surprising.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">If the projects are serious &#8212; meaning they are more than experiments or attempts at leverage for the coming discussion it will have with Microsoft on per-search revenue &#8212; Yahoo could be working to create a product that will replace nearly one-third of its current revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">In its calendar third quarter of last year, Yahoo earned 31 percent of its total revenue from the search deal with Microsoft.</span></p>
<p>As a <a target="_blank" href="http://searchengineland.com/yahoo-sec-microsoft-179536">percentage of its revenue</a>, the Bing search deal is of growing importance to Yahoo. For the nine months ending last September 30, 30 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue came from the deal, or slightly less over the nine-quarter period than the last quarter reported.</p>
<p>More dramatically, its 2012 third quarter &#8212; comparable to the 31 percent number &#8212; saw 27 percent of its revenue come from the Microsoft deal. And in the nine-month period ending with the third quarter of 2012, Yahoo earned a more modest 24 percent of its top line from Microsoft.</p>
<p>So, 24 to 27 to 30 to 31 percent. That&#8217;s a steady progression.</p>
<p>What is driving that momentum, given that Yahoo is <a target="_blank" href="http://searchengineland.com/search-market-share-bing-continues-to-grow-at-yahoos-expense-176896">consistently losing search market share</a>? I&#8217;d estimate that its <em>other</em> revenues, which are declining, are doing so more quickly than income from the Microsoft deal. Recall that Microsoft last year <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-agrees-to-extend-yahoo-revenue-per-search-deal-7000015024/">re-upped its revenue guarantee</a> with Yahoo in regards to its search agreement for the U.S.</p>
<p>Financially, therefore, the Microsoft deal is something of a boon for Yahoo, providing revenue stability in a time of transition for the latter company.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">That&#8217;s the nice way to put it. In reality, Yahoo needs that firehose of Redmond dollars to cover for it as it uses future </span><a>Alibaba money</a><span style="line-height:1.625;"> to (hopefully) buy revenue momentum. So far that isn&#8217;t working, </span><a>as we recently saw</a><span style="line-height:1.625;">.</span></p>
<p>And Yahoo may be working to cut this income flow and forge a new path for itself. You could call that bold. But there is a fine line between boldness and overzealousness (leadership, you could argue, lies in between).</p>
<p>Microsoft and Yahoo both declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>While that may be the case, it&#8217;s worth keeping in mind that Yahoo has old search chops, Mayer is brilliant, and the company is on a decent personnel footing. It could pull off a transition back to search. And, perhaps, Yahoo could deploy enough of that Alibaba cash to snag a few Googlers to pull the operation together.</p>
<p>Yahoo was said to <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323372504578469401316209428">complain last year</a> that revenue per search was actually worse with Microsoft under the agreement than it had been when the company used its own technology. That&#8217;s a point in favor of Yahoo trying again. The company may be able to opt out of the deal in mid 2015.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.625;">But search, as the saying goes, is hard. Microsoft, a company with a few good heads in it, has spent years &#8212; <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/01/25/microsoft-5/#!t6Cwd">and billions</a> &#8212; building Bing. </span></p>
<p>And despite that work and treasure, Bing has yet to mature to the point in which Yahoo and Microsoft <em>didn&#8217;t need the search revenue </em><i>guarantee</i>. That means that Bing was monetizing at below the set threshold, forcing Microsoft to fork over more cash to keep Sunnyvale on board.</p>
<p>So, after billions and years, Microsoft&#8217;s search technology still isn&#8217;t so good at making money.</p>
<p>For Yahoo, that&#8217;s the mission at the moment. It needs to grow its revenue. And, at this precise moment, it appears that the company is moving instead to replace a stable, and likely renewable revenue stream.</p>
